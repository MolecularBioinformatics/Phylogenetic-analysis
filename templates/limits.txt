# This file defines limits for proteins. The columns should be whitespace-separated.
# Empty lines and everything behind hashes is ignored.
# The first column contains the protein name.
# The second column contains the highest evalue that should be allowed.
# The third column contains the lowest length that should be allowed.

# The `default` values are used when there are no values for a given protein.
# Unspecified values must be marked with some letter or string (e.g. `x`).
# Default values will be taken for unspecified values.

# The file has effect in step 2 (combine parsed results) of the workflow.
