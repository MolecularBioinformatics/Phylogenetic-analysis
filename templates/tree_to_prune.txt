# This file contains information about which nodes should be truncated or
# deleted. Everything in a line after a hash (#) is ignored. Empty lines are
# ignored.
# There are some keywords to switch the modes of action. To switch the mode of
# action, a line must start with a ! directly followed by the keyword with
# nothing else in the line. Possible keywords are:
#
# !pruneafter
# All children of the given node are pruned. That is, the node is kept, but all
# child nodes are detached
#
# !pruneafterchildren
# The children of the given node are kept but all of their children are pruned.
# So all grandchildren are detached.
#
# !dontprune
# All nodes given here are *not* pruned or detached. However, if a higher-level
# node is detached, this one is deleted as well.
#
# !detach
# These nodes are directly detached.
#
# !delete
# These nodes are deleted but all children are attached to the parent of this
# node. All !delete instructions will be performed after all other instructions
# were done.
#
# The nodes itself must be given one in each line with either the name, the
# taxid or the combination name^taxid. The name is sufficient in most cases,
# but certain names are ambiguous. When there are two nodes with the same name,
# both will be affected. In these cases, write either taxid or name^taxid.
# Examples for ambiguous names are (by far not complete):
# - Aphelia (A moth and a plant)
# - Bacteria (!) (The kingdom and an insect genus)
# - Yersinia (Enterobacteria and mantids (insects))
